Practical cheat sheets
======================

>Disclaimer: This cheat sheets is summarized from my personal experience and other online resources and therefore should not be considered as the official documentation.

This repository provides a quick access to the most frequently used commands of various development tools. Some of the cheat sheets I'm using on a daily basis myself and I think everybody could benefit from using them as well. The content of all the cheat sheets is easily obtainable on the Internet and was originally taken from official documentations and books.

## Why on GitHub?
Having all the necessary cheat sheets in one repository lets me keep track of the history of changes and enables people to easily contribute to them.

Feel free to take advantage of the cheat sheets to learn new stuff and to have them at hand in case you forgot about one command. Any suggestions are welcome.
